title: Pivoting expectations in data analysis
subtitle: A journey through different hypotheses in archery data.

The scope of this data exploration and analysis changed several times over a couple of weeks. I originally requested World Archery API access without any particular data in mind, but during the emails with Chris Wells, my contact at World Archery, we agreed that an interesting place to start would be historical data regarding the Olympics, and how the Olympics affects arrow averages in tournaments before, during, and after the Olympics themselves.

## The Olympics

I began by taking making an API call that would return all competitions within a given time frame, starting off in the year the Rio Summer Olympics too place. It was this point when I started to realize the sort of state the data was in.
```json
{
  "pageInfo": {
    "totalResults": 1339,
    "resultsPerPage": 10,
    "page": 0
  },
  "items": [...
```
However, after a bit of looking, I realized a lot of these competition entries had no data associated with them. No results turned in. Luckily there was an option to perform the API in such a way that only competitions with results would return.

```json
{
  "pageInfo": {
    "totalResults": 35,
    "resultsPerPage": 10,
    "page": 0
  },
  "items": [...
 ```
 Over 1300 results eliminated with no useful data to us. Only 35 events remained out of 1339 total events in 2016. So now all we need to do is pull the scores from each, get an average, and toss it on a plot to see where everything lines up at.

... Except there's still a couple things we're forgetting that requires a little explanation of Olympic format to understand. Olympic Archery competitions, at least for Recurve, operate under the Freestyle Recurve format. This format takes place outside, at 70 meters, with a 122cm target face, with scores ranging from 1 to 10, with zero for a miss. The data we're specifically looking at for comparing the Olympics to other events is the average of all arrows shot during an elimination match.

In our data, we have competitions like the Dublin 2016 World Archery Field Championships. Unfortunately, we can't really compare field archery to Freestyle Recurve for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it uses an entirely different score system, from 0 to 6 rather than 0 to 10. Secondly, field archers are often required to make strange shots, such as shooting uphill at a 20 degree angle, or standing on the side of a hill and shooting down at a target, and all from a variety of ranges. It would not be fair to compare Field and Freestyle Recurve.

But it doesn't stop there, as we have the Marrakesh 2016 Indoor Archery World Cup Stage. As the name suggests, this specific format of archery is called Indoor Archery, and the difference is more than the lack of wind. Indoor Archers shoot at a target that is 18 meters away instead of 70 meters, as well as at a smaller, 40cm target with three faces, one for each arrow of the set. Archers are typically so accurate in this format that they would often damage arrows if they shot at the same target face. So, with the closer range, different target size, and overall accuracy improvements, it would not be fair to compare Indoor archery with Freestyle Recurve.

There are a few other formats which also dont fit in well with Freestyle recurve, like Para Archery (think like Paralympics), that also shouldn't be directly compared.

After getting rid of all of the unsuitable formats, as well as the competitions that did not have sufficient data (such as including results about the match, but not recording specific arrow scores), we have reduced our 35 competitions down to... six. Not exactly a large sample size. 

In addition to the 2016 data, I also collected data from three years before and three years after, to see if I could catch any trends. Some years had more results than 2016 (2015 with 10, 2018 with 14) and one other year (2014) had 6 usable competitions. 2013 had no usable data at all. At this point I graphed all of the data I collected, originally starting with a line plot, with each year being a different line, but my low sample size did me no favors in this case. I then decided to group all of the competitions by month and display them all together.

Well, the olympics appears to be a slightly above average event as far as this is concerned, but more interesting is the sort of sine wave pattern that the data shows, with peaks in april and late september, and a valley in july and over the holidays. The original question regarding the Olympics was a bust, and this strange seasonal bias was clearly what I should be exploring.

## The Seasonal Bias 

The analysis of tournament data from 2014-2018 was not fruitful for this specific hypothesis, that the olympics in some way affected archery arrow averages. In fact the Olympics seemed to be a perfectly standard archery event as far as averages go.

However, to figure that out, I had to see what was typical for each year. I plotted each year's averages on top of each other and it showed a significant seasonal bias, with peaks in April and October, and a major trough in July (and presumably around the holidays, when no tournaments take place)

So in order to confirm this, I looked at averages from Qualifier rounds, which gave me more data than just the matches alone did. This seasonal bias on the world cup level was a lot less pronounced, but still there. However filtering the data and excluding world cup events, this july trough is virtually non-existant.

This caused me to pivot my hypothesis again, this time leaning towards something in the world cup, in the summer months, causing this minor dip. I separated out the data and unfortunately, this is where my trail ends. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to determine any sort of cause for this dip, but it is consistent over several years.
