title: Pivoting expectations in data analysis
subtitle: A journey through different hypotheses in archery data.
---


The original scope of this data exploration was to see what effect, if any, the olympics has on average scores, looking before during and after.
The analysis of tournament data from 2014-2018 was not fruitful for this specific hypothesis, that the olympics in some way affected archery arrow averages. In fact the Olympics seemed to be a perfectly standard archery event as far as averages go.

However, to figure that out, I had to see what was typical for each year. I plotted each year's averages on top of each other and it showed a significant seasonal bias, with peaks in April and October, and a major trough in July (and presumably around the holidays, when no tournaments take place)

So in order to confirm this, I looked at averages from Qualifier rounds, which gave me more data than just the matches alone did. This seasonal bias on the world cup level was a lot less pronounced, but still there. However filtering the data and excluding world cup events, this july trough is virtually non-existant.

This caused me to pivot my hypothesis again, this time leaning towards something in the world cup, in the summer months, causing this minor dip. I separated out the data and unfortunately, this is where my trail ends. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to determine any sort of cause for this dip, but it is consistent over several years.
