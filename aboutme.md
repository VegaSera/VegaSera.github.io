Hello, my name is Wesley Mountford and I'm a data scientist with a desire to not only learn, but to have a deep understanding of the things I work with. Over the past few years, I have jumped from hobby to hobby, everything from woodworking, both small and large metalworking, robotics, leatherworking, painting, sculpting, archery, cycling, and the list goes on and on. I am a lifelong learner with an insatiable appetite for learning new skills.

Proficient in the following technologies:

- Python 
- Tensorflow/Keras
- SKLearn
- MatPlotLib/Plotly
- Statistics
- AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, S3)
- Flask / Fast API / Django
- OpenCV
